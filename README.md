# News Site
This project was done during week 2 in Technigo bootcamp. I did a newspaper site whilst learning how to structure webpages using boxmodel, layout webpages with flexbox and doing a responsive webpage for mobile, tablet and desktop. 

## The problem
In the beginning I had an overly complex layout in mind and had trouble getting the page content to end up where it should be. 

I have asked my teammates when I needed help, googled, watched videos and used code games to understand flexbox better.

I find it easy to get caught up in the details. And I need to learn to do the bigger structure first as that will save me time. For example I could have started only doing an almost empty html together with a flexbox layout, and immediately tried that out as a responsive webpage for different device sizes. 

Code got a bit cluttered at some point as I kept on changing names on classes continously whilst coding which obviously made it harder to style. I thank the inspector tool a hundred million times 🙏🏽. An important step was to delete redundant code in style.css

If I had more time I would have done a second menu to take over in tablet and mobile view, and hide the nav-items created for desktop.
I tried this out very last minute, and did not manage so I decided to take it away to have a cleaner webpage at the end.
