        <h3>Coronavirus vaccine: What are human challenge trials?</h3>
        Volunteers are set to be deliberately infected with Covid-19 after the UK Government said it will set up human challenge trials to speed up the development of a vaccine.<br><br>
        Getting vaccines, and preferably those that are easier to use in poor countries than the mRNA vaccine from Pfizer and Moderna that must be shipped frozen, is a motive to join the volunteer organization.<br><br>
        Volunteers say <i>it is very much about justice</i>. According to forecasts, low- and middle-income countries in the world will not receive any corona vaccines until 2022. <br><br>
